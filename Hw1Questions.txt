Reflection on Process-Centered vs. Data-Centered Approaches
In the two versions of the program, a clear distinction emerges between process-centered and data-centered approaches. The first version, Process-Centered (Version 1), 
focuses on the procedures for manipulating data. The MyMain class, with static methods for storing, displaying, and finding persons, exemplifies this approach. 
Here, the program logic is tightly coupled with the data operations, and methods are directly invoked from the main method. This structure emphasizes procedural 
operations and manages control flow explicitly, making it more process-oriented.

In contrast, the Data-Centered (Version 2) approach, represented by the PersonList class, emphasizes managing data through a dedicated class that encapsulates both the 
data and related operations. The PersonList class manages its own LinkedList and provides methods for data manipulation, such as store, display, and find. This approach 
abstracts data management within a class, promoting encapsulation and modularity. It focuses on creating a coherent data structure and managing operations in a more 
organized manner, making it inherently data-oriented.

To reduce coding effort in the data-centered approach, several features could be added to the LinkedList class. Enhancing the LinkedList with built-in search methods, 
like findById(String id), would streamline data retrieval and eliminate the need for custom search logic. Convenience methods for batch operations (e.g., addAll and 
removeAll) could simplify adding or removing multiple elements, while custom iterators could support more expressive data processing. Additionally, integrating data 
validation mechanisms directly within list operations would ensure data integrity and reduce separate validation code. Finally, improved serialization support for 
reading and writing list contents would simplify file operations, making the code more concise and easier to maintain. These enhancements would significantly streamline 
operations and improve overall code efficiency.
